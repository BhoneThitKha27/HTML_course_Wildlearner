# WildLearner HTML Course

This repo includes everything I practiced while completing the [HTML Course on WildLearner](https://wildlearner.com/learn/course/html).

## Whatâ€™s Inside

- Basic HTML structure
- Text elements (headings, paragraphs)
- Links and images
- Lists and tables
- Forms and inputs
- Semantic tags

## Note

I built each file while learning, just to understand how HTML works in real use.

## Credits

Thanks to ChatGPT for helping me out through the course.
